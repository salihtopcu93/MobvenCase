# MobvenCase

Mobvencase is an iOS mobile application that displays the imdb results that conform the search criteria using the imdb API.

MVVM architecture is used in mobvencase application.
Because MVVM is a more modular, flexible, readable, testable and sustainable architecture than MVC.

If I had time I would change the design, spend more time on UX. I would add a Unit Test.

I would like to add more information, player list and score information to the IMDB API.

To make the project ready, go to the project directory and add 'pod install' to the terminal screen.

The project does not require any special tools to operate.

Supports all versions of iOS 9 and later.
